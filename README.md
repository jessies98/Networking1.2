<h1>Layer 3 Spine-Leaf Data Center Network with OSPF and EtherChannel</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
This project is a simulation of a modern data center network using a spine-leaf architecture in Cisco Packet Tracer. The design consists of 2 spine switches and 3 leaf switches, all configured as Layer 3 switches to support high-performance routing across the topology.

The primary goal of this design is to demonstrate scalable, redundant, and efficient communication between endpoints in a data center environment.

Key features of the project include:

Spine-Leaf Architecture:
- Two spine switches serve as the high-speed backbone of the network.
- Three leaf switches act as access switches, each connecting to servers and the spines.
- Every leaf is connected to every spine to ensure non-blocking, low-latency communication.

Layer 3 Routing:
- All switches are configured for Layer 3 routing using OSPF (Open Shortest Path First).
- Routed point-to-point links are established between spines and leaves using no switchport interfaces.
- SVIs (Switched Virtual Interfaces) are configured for internal IP reachability.

EtherChannel (Port-Channel) Configuration:
- EtherChannel is implemented between leaf and spine switches to increase bandwidth, ensure redundancy, and enable load balancing.
- Multiple physical links are bundled into logical port-channels to prevent STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) blockages and improve throughput.

End Devices:
- Multiple servers are connected to the leaf switches to simulate real-world enterprise services.
- The design ensures that all servers can communicate through the spines via dynamic routing and port aggregation.
